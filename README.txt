Review Submission plugin  (aka "UI Activity Grader")
--------------------------------

This submission plugins for the assign module allows a teacher to grade an
assignment based on a student's participation in a forum.  Future updates may
add other activity types such as WIKIs.


==Installation==

1. Unzip the submission review plugin files to folders on
  your local machine

2. Upload the plugin files to <siteroot>/mod/assign/submission/review

3. Log in to Moodle as administrator, then click on 'Home'.

  There are currently no dynamically configurable settings to worry about.
  

==How to use==

* Add a forum to a course

* Add a new Assignment to the course.

* In the assignment settings, under submission types, check the box for
  "UI Activity Grader".
 
  The Activity Grader settings box should appear.  Select the "Forum" activity type, and for 
  "Forum Name" choose the forum you created above.  Click on the ? icon next to "Grading Tips"
  for advice on setting up grading.
  
  Submissions of this type do not use the usual submission channels, so the submission settings block can
  be ignored.  When an instructor goes into the grading menus, the submission status for students is 
  automatically updated based on their posts to the forum.
  
  When grading a students submission, the review plugin will display the students posts and issue warnings
  when the student has not met the prescribed criteria.
